# Cleaning_and_merging_data

My submission for the assignment of week 4 is attached herewith in file run_analysis.R

The file contains the following:

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
    The tidy data is contained in the file tidydata.txt
